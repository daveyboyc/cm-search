ðŸ”§ PAYMENT SYSTEM ANALYSIS & FIX NEEDED

CURRENT ISSUE:
- Your payment system is set to mode='subscription' 
- But you're doing one-time Â£5 payments
- Webhook only handles subscription events
- One-time payments generate 'payment_intent.succeeded' events

TO FIX FOR PRODUCTION:

1. CHANGE PAYMENT MODE in accounts/views.py:
   Line 275: mode='subscription'  ->  mode='payment'

2. ADD WEBHOOK HANDLER for one-time payments:
   Add handler for 'payment_intent.succeeded' event

3. UPDATE STRIPE PRODUCT:
   Create a one-time Â£5 product instead of subscription

4. SET WEBHOOK ENDPOINT in Stripe Dashboard:
   Point to: https://capacitymarket.co.uk/accounts/stripe/webhook/

FOR LOCAL TESTING:
Run: python simulate_payment_success.py
This will manually grant access without needing real payments.

# In accounts/views.py, change line 275:

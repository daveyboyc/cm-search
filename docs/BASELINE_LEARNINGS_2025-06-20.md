# Capacity Market Weekly Monitoring - Baseline Learnings
**Date:** June 20, 2025  
**First Comprehensive Test Crawl**

## üìä Initial Data State - Baseline Snapshot

### Core Database Metrics
- **Total Components:** 63,847 capacity market components
- **Data Freshness:** 7 days old (last updated: June 12, 2025)
- **Distinct Auctions:** 23 different auction periods tracked
- **CMU Registry Records:** 11,838 capacity market units

### Top Auction Distribution (Component Count)
1. **2024-25 (T-1) One Year Ahead:** 8,446 components (13.2%)
2. **2023-24 (T-1) One Year Ahead:** 6,826 components (10.7%)  
3. **2027-28 (T-4) Four Year Ahead:** 5,704 components (8.9%)
4. **2024-25 (T-4) Four Year Ahead:** 4,935 components (7.7%)
5. **2026-27 (T-4) Four Year Ahead:** 4,699 components (7.4%)

## üîç Key Initial Observations

### Data Patterns Discovered
- **T-1 Auctions dominate** recent years (2023-24, 2024-25) with highest component counts
- **T-4 Auctions show forward planning** with substantial allocations for 2026-28
- **Data age of 7 days** suggests regular but not daily updates from NESO
- **23 distinct auction periods** indicates comprehensive historical coverage

### API Monitoring Results
- **Future Auctions (2029-33):** All showing 0 local records, API errors for future years
- **API Status:** Successfully connected but no future auction data available yet
- **Monitoring Strategy:** Focus on 2029+ years to detect genuinely new auction announcements

## üí° Learning Framework Established

### What We've Learned About the Data Structure
1. **Component Distribution:** Clear preference for T-1 (one-year-ahead) auctions in recent periods
2. **Historical Depth:** Strong coverage back through multiple auction cycles  
3. **Update Frequency:** Weekly update cycle appears standard (7-day age)
4. **Future Planning:** T-4 auctions provide 4-year advance capacity planning

### Monitoring Strategy Validation
‚úÖ **Baseline Created:** 63,847 components as starting reference point  
‚úÖ **Future Focus Working:** 2029+ monitoring prevents false positives from historical data  
‚úÖ **Error Handling:** Graceful handling of API errors for non-existent future auctions  
‚úÖ **Historical Tracking:** Weekly records saved for pattern recognition  

## üéØ Next Week's Expectations

### What to Watch For
- **Component Count Changes:** Expect minimal change (+/- 50 components) in weekly updates
- **Data Freshness:** Should improve from 7 days to 0-2 days if NESO updates
- **New Auction Announcements:** Any 2029+ data would indicate major new capacity planning
- **Baseline Stability:** Confirm our 63,847 baseline remains stable reference point

### Success Metrics for Week 2
- [ ] Data age decreases (fresher data)
- [ ] Component count remains stable (¬±100 components)  
- [ ] No false positive alerts from historical data
- [ ] Continued API connectivity for monitoring

## üìà Comparative Framework for Future Weeks

### Week-over-Week Tracking
Each week we'll compare:
1. **Component count delta** from baseline (63,847)
2. **Data freshness improvement** (currently 7 days)
3. **New auction announcements** (focus on 2029+)
4. **API reliability** and error patterns

### Learning Accumulation
- **Week 1 (Baseline):** Established monitoring framework
- **Week 2:** Will track first changes and validate stability
- **Week 3+:** Pattern recognition and trend analysis

## üîß Technical Validation

### System Performance
- **Monitoring Duration:** 4.9 seconds end-to-end
- **Email Delivery:** Successfully sent via Mailgun
- **Error Handling:** All field errors resolved, type checking working
- **Documentation:** Automated MD file generation working

### Infrastructure Status
‚úÖ Celery integration ready for automation  
‚úÖ Historical baseline and tracking files created  
‚úÖ Email reporting functional  
‚úÖ API connectivity established  

---

**Next Action:** Set up weekly cron job for automated monitoring
**Key Insight:** Focus on 2029+ years provides clean signal for new capacity announcements
**Success Measure:** Week 2 should show data freshness improvement and stable component counts

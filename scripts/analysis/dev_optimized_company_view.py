Now that we've added monitoring, here's how to see if the optimization worked:

1. 📖 CHECK THE LOGS:
   After visiting a company page, look for log entries like:
   
   🚀 EGRESS-OPTIMIZED company view for 'GridBeyond Limited':
      📊 Total locations: 1,234
      📋 Displayed: 50 items (page 1)
      🔍 Metadata sample: 100 locations
      💾 Database queries: 4
      📦 Rows fetched: 150
      📊 Estimated data: 45,000 bytes (43.9 KB)
      ⏱️  Load time: 0.023s
      🔧 Filters: status=all, auction=all
      💡 Estimated egress reduction: 96.4% (1,482,000 → 45,000 bytes)

2. 🔗 TEST THESE URLS:
""")

test_urls = [
    ("Small company", "http://localhost:8000/company-optimized/vitalenergi/"),
    ("Large company", "http://localhost:8000/company-optimized/gridbeyondlimited/"),
    ("With active filter", "http://localhost:8000/company-optimized/gridbeyondlimited/?status=active"),
    ("With auction filter", "http://localhost:8000/company-optimized/gridbeyondlimited/?auction=T-4%202024-25"),
]

for name, url in test_urls:
    print(f"   {name}: {url}")

print("""
3. 📊 WHAT TO LOOK FOR:

   ✅ SUCCESS INDICATORS:
   - "Estimated egress reduction: 90-99%"
   - "Rows fetched: 50-150" (instead of thousands)
   - "Database queries: 3-5" (efficient)
   - Same results displayed as before

   ❌ ISSUES TO WATCH:
   - "Rows fetched: 1000+" (optimization not working)
   - Template errors or missing data
   - Different results than before

4. 🔍 HOW TO CHECK LOGS:

   In your terminal running the Django server, look for the log output
   after visiting the company pages.

5. 💡 WHY SPEED MIGHT NOT BE NOTICEABLE:

   - Local database is already fast
   - Small dataset in development  
   - Browser caching
   - The REAL benefit is egress reduction in production!

6. 🎯 EXPECTED RESULTS:

   For a company with 1,000 locations:
   - OLD: Would fetch 1,000 × 24 fields = 1.2MB
   - NEW: Fetches 50 × 6 fields + 100 × 3 fields = 45KB
   - REDUCTION: 96%+ egress savings!

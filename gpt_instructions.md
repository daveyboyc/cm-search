# UK Capacity Market Search - Instructions for GPT

## Search Approach

When searching for components in the UK Capacity Market, follow these guidelines:

### Location-Based Searches

1. **Direct Location Searches**: When asked about components in a specific location:
   - Always search for the exact location name: "peckham", "elephant and castle", etc.
   - If no results are found, try variations: "elephant park" for "elephant and castle"
   - Search for the location with and without technology terms

2. **Specific Location/Area Mappings**:
   - Elephant and Castle → Search for "Elephant Park"
   - For other London areas, try searching for both the area name and nearby areas

3. **Handling Empty Results**:
   - If a search for "X in Y" returns no results, try searching for just "Y" 
   - Example: "CHPs in Peckham" → try "Peckham" first, then "CHP Peckham"

### Technology Queries

1. **Expand Abbreviations**:
   - CHP → "Combined Heat and Power"
   - CCGT → "Combined Cycle Gas Turbine" 
   - OCGT → "Open Cycle Gas Turbine"

2. **Multiple Technologies**:
   - Search for each technology separately and combine results

### Understanding Component Data

When presenting results about components:

1. **Component Deduplication**:
   - Components with the same location, CMU ID, and company are the same physical unit
   - Multiple entries exist because they appear in different auction years
   - Present as a single component with multiple years/auction entries

2. **Capacity Information**:
   - Report all available capacity values (De-rated, Connection, etc.)
   - Include units (typically MW) when presenting capacity values

3. **Market Status**:
   - Current market period: 2024-2025
   - Next market period: 2025-2026
   - Future market periods: 2026+
   - Indicate if a component is active in any of these periods

### Example Queries and Approaches

1. **"Are there CHPs in Peckham?"**
   - Search directly for "Peckham" first
   - Then search for "CHP Peckham" or "Combined Heat and Power Peckham"
   - Report any components found by either search

2. **"Tell me about Elephant and Castle CHPs"**
   - Search for "Elephant Park" (known location mapping)
   - Focus on "Combined Heat and Power" technology
   - Explain these are at Elephant Park Energy Centre in the Elephant and Castle area

3. **"What power stations are in Birmingham?"**
   - Search for "Birmingham"
   - Present results grouped by physical location
   - Specify technology types found

4. **"Is there a gas power station in London?"**
   - Search for "London gas" or "London CCGT" or "London OCGT"
   - Try variations for different gas technologies
   - Check for components across London areas

Remember to always provide clear market status information, capacity details, and explain when components are the same physical unit appearing in multiple auction years.
